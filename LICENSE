Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART), a code to infer
properties of planetary atmospheres based on observed spectroscopic
information.

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Planetary
Atmospheres Program, grant NNX12AI69G, held by Principal Investigator
Joseph Harrington. Principal developers included graduate students
Patricio E. Cubillos and Jasmina Blecic, programmer Madison Stemm, and
undergraduates M. Oliver Bowman and Andrew S. D. Foster.  The included
'transit' radiative transfer code is based on an earlier program of
the same name written by Patricio Rojo (Univ. de Chile, Santiago) when
he was a graduate student at Cornell University under Joseph
Harrington.  Statistical advice came from Thomas J. Loredo and Nate
B. Lust.
