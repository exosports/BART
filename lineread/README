PRE-REQUIREMENTS:

  pu library: This is a C code library by Patricio Rojo available
              under the GNU General Public License on the author's
              website: http://www.das.uchile.cl/~pato/sw/. Version
              1.28 of this library was used for this version of
              transit.
  line database(s): This are a requirement to run lineread, not to compile
              it.  Supported databases are shown below.

=======================================================================
LINE DATABASES:
  P&S Water Lines:  The water transition database in a version readable
              by this program is available from Dr. Robert L. Kurucz's
              website:  http://kurucz.harvard.edu/molecules/H2O/.
              Original data from Harry Partridge and David W. Schwenke
              in J. Chem. Phys. 106, pp 4618-4639, 1997.

========================================================================
COMPILATION: 

  Edit Makefile to make sure that BIN is the directory where you want
the binaries to be.  Then, execute one after the other the following
commands:

   make clean
   make 
   make install

========================================================================
EXECUTING LINEREAD:
  This program is used to build the binary TLI file that transit uses.
Right now it can only read the Partridge and Schwenke database as
prepared by Kurucz in the default location:
    ./oth/pands/h2ofast.bin
    ./oth/pands/h2opartfn.dat

  To get a list of options

   lineread -h
