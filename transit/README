========================================================================
PRE-REQUIREMENTS:

  GSL & BLAS libraries: Available from the GNU repository at:
              http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.  Version 1.8 from GSL,
              and 1.2 from BLAS was used to compile this version of
              transit.
  pu library: This is a C code library by Patricio Rojo available
              under the GNU General Public License on the author's
              website: http://www.das.uchile.cl/~pato/sw/. Version
              1.28 of this library was used for this version of
              transit.
  TLI database: This is a requirement to run transit, not to compile
              it.  The format and sorting order of the database is
              arranged by auxiliary program lineread.

========================================================================
COMPILATION: 

  Edit Makefile to make sure that BIN is the directory where you want
the binaries to be.  Then, execute one after the other the following
commands:

   make clean
   make transit
   make install

========================================================================
EXECUTING TRANSIT:
 To get a comprehensive built-in help, run

   transit -h

 By default it reads the following TLI file: './res/lineread.tli'.
Use the option --linedb if the file is located somewhere else.
