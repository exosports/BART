#Comments are ignored.  Parameter lines *lines starting withj an
#identifier, could appear in any order unless otherwise specified.
#Atmospheric profile (non-parameter ) lines must come after all
#parameter lines.

#An optional line starting with 'n' stores identification info about
#the file (e.g., 'Data from Blah et al. 2009'). Only the first of such
#lines will be stored
n <source of this info>


#Indication of whether abundances below are by mass or number.  Only
#one such line should exist indicating abundances by mass or by
#number.  This parameter has precedence over the command line option.
q mass
#or
q number


#Unit conversion or offset.  Optional factors can also be specified in
#a line starting with u<variable>, where <variable> can be either 'r',
#'t', or 'p' for radius, temperature or pressure, respectively.  These
#quantities will be in c.g.s. units after being multiplied by such
#factors.  The optional radius offset is specified in file
#units. i.e., before multiplication by the 'ur' factor.
ur <factor to convert radius to cm>
ut <factor to convert temperature to K>
up <factor to convert pressure to dynes/cm2>
z  <radius offset in same units as tabulated data>


#Lines starting with i contain isotope information.  The number of
#isotopes must coincide with the number of abundance columns in the
#atmospheric profile lines below.
i <mass1-name1>           <mass2-name2>
i <mass3name3>
i    <mass4-name4> <mass5-name5>

#An isotope starting with '!' is ignored but has to have a column
#below.  This can be used for reference to isotopes specified in lines
#with 'f'.
i !<massi6-namei6>


#Lines starting with f contain isotopes that are going to be obtained
#from other isotopes abundances.  Equal sign is optional.  They MUST
#come after 'i' lines.

#In the following example the 7th isotope will have <fct> times the
#abundance of the Xth isotope.
f <massi7-namei7> = <fct> <nameX>

#You can use the special keyword 'other' as the reference isotope to
#indicate that the reference abundance will be whathever is needed to
#complete a total abundance of 1.  The line below sets the abundance
#of the 8th isotope to <fct> of the non-accounted atmospheric
#abundance (typically used for Helium and Hydrogen abundances)
f <massi8-namei8> <fct> other


#From the first non-keyworded line everything is atmospheric info
<radius1> <pressure1> <temperature1> <abund1,iso1> ... <abund1,iso6>
<radius2> <pressure2> <temperature2> <abund2,iso1> ... <abund2,iso6>
