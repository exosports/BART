2012-12-18  Patricio Rojo <pato@das.uchile.cl>

	* Release 4.0
	* nIso and nT changed cleanly to 'unsigned short'
	* Added comment about ignored saha equation
	* Removed deprecated (never implemented) option telres
	* Added \n to some warnings messages
	* Warnings added if critical tau was found at odd depths

2008-09-23  Patricio Rojo <pato@das.uchile.cl>

	* Release 4.0rc2
	* Enable reading of TLI v4
	* Improved verbosity
	* Cleaned unit's mess in makesample.c
	* Copyright notice updated.
	* lineread is being developed independently of transit now.  It
	has its own directory structure in CVS.
	* Magic bit enabled.

2006-07-26  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 3.3
	* Several memory leaks fixed after running 'valgrind'.
	* Using ccd-gcc.sh to compile with the right dependencies.
	* Improved verbosity in several places.
	* This changelog was written from an old cvstags file.
	* Added saveext function to store all the computed extinction
	array.  This is physically valid only when radius is the only
	difference between two runs.
	* Improving transiterror() so that now it can print filename
	and line number.
	* Adding 'starrad' option.
	* Improved README and documentation files.
	
2004-11-16  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 3.2
	* First really stable version
	* CIA enabled
	* Clouds enabled
	* Results shown in DPS04

2004-09-21  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 3.1
	* Fixed a bug that made unusual peaks in the spectrum due to
	accesing out of memory sectors
	* Scattering started but not enabled

2004-09-04  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 3.0
	* Working modulation without clouds or scattering

2004-08-31  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 3.0rc2
	* Fixed bug regarding to P&S
	* Result is suspected too small
	* Major changes in atmosphere reading

2004-07-14  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 2.2
	* Modulation integration is debugged

2004-07-10  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 2.1
	* Tau calculation is debugged

2004-05-18  Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 2.0
	* Modulation is working for the simplest model

2004-XX-XX Patricio Rojo <pato@astro.cornell.edu>

	* Release 2.0pre3: Tau along a line of sight is
	functional. Working in geometry
	* Release 2.0pre2: Bug fixes in significative digits, lineread
	compilation, nonnegative abundances. Radius*wavenumber allocation
	fails, working per wavenumber from now.
	* Release 2.0pre1: Start working in tau()
	* Release 1.2: Portability and onept fixes
	* Release 1.1: Extinction computed for more than one radius
	* Release 1.0: Atmosphere given per file, command line, or
	interactively. Use of version 2 of TWII. Extinction computed
	successfully.
	* Release 1.0pre3: Atmophere file reading should be working.
	* Release 1.0pre2: Multiple extra isotopes. linear interpolation
	for atmosphere.
	* Release 1.0pre1: ASCII reading of TWII should be working. Fixed
	Voigt profile (average rather than sum per bin). Fixes total
	pressure (now uses mean molecular weight). TD: Lorentz profile
	only uses one specie rather than an average.
	* Release 1.0pre0: All (?) but ASCII TWII should be working.
