PU v1.28

--------------

PU is a series of general utilities intended mainly to make
programming in C simpler:D.

These routines have been developed by Patricio Rojo since 1999.  The
webpage is http://www.das.uchile.cl/~pato/sw

Some documentation is given as comments in the source files in the
src/ directory, where the functions are packed according to 6
categories:

iomisc.c:    Contains miscellaneous I/O functions.
numerical.c: Contains miscellaneous numerical functions.
procopt.c:   Powerful argument parser that extends GNU's
             getopt(). Fairly well documentated.
sampling.c:  Functions that are helpful to resample data.
voigt.c:     Functions to compute the Voigt Profile.
xmalloc.c:   Simple implementations of memory allocation functions
             with memory checking.  Functions are slightly modified
             from GNU's release.
