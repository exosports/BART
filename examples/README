The files in the 'demo' folder correspond to the quick demo shown in the
project's front page (https://github.com/exosports/BART).

The BART_example.cfg is an example configuration file to run the BART code.
Note that the demo config file does NOT contain all the possible variables
that a full BART run can have.  Use the BART_example.cfg file for a
real-life run.
